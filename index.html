I didn't know anyone and saw that students and LLC Peer Mentors were getting dunked in the dunk tank for free shirts. I decided this could be a great way to make friends and brag to my family that I did something cool during my first week. I got dunked pretty quickly and walked back to my dorm soaking wet, but with new friends!"
        data-why="I got into LSG after responding to a message sent out to a Luddy Student Leaders Teams Channel. I expressed interest in helping LSG get restarted, and worked with Mia Sears (LSG's Vice President) to rebuild the organization. I was inspired to work on this team because of my love for Luddy and it's people. This school has really given me a place to grow, and I've met some of the most important people in my life in Luddy classes and organizations. Anything I can do to make this school a better place and help the people in it is an opportunity I will jump at given the chance!"

I have enjoyed my time as a Luddy student and I wanted to get more connected with people outside of my major and learn more about the school as a whole.

The orientation week before classes began was especially memorable; I met new friends and felt a real sense of belonging. Another highlight was the Diwali celebration. It was my first one away from home, and the food, fireworks, and community spirit made it feel truly special."
        data-why="I got involved with LSG because I was looking for more ways to be engaged with the Luddy community. I’ve always enjoyed taking part in extracurriculars and leadership roles, but many other organizations either didn’t quite resonate with me or required commitments that were hard to balance. When I came across LSG, it felt like the perfect fit — a meaningful way to get involved while managing other priorities. My first meeting with Addie and Mia confirmed that feeling; they were both so welcoming and clearly dedicated to leading the organization with purpose."
        data-extra="Outside of academics, I love exploring new places around Bloomington, watching movies, and trying out new recipes. I also enjoy listening to music and discovering new matcha/bubble tea spots around town—it’s my favorite way to unwind and get inspired."
